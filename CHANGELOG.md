# Changelog

All notable changes to Lumos are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Monorepo scaffold with pnpm workspaces (`apps/daemon`, `apps/desktop`, `packages`).
- Daemon core: command parser, vault writer, message handler, Fastify HTTP API.
- WhatsApp bridge via Baileys with QR authentication, sender allowlist, and auto-reconnect.
- Project documentation: `PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `FEATURES.md`,
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the `docs/` set.
- Shared workspace packages: `@lumos/shared` (core types) and `@lumos/vault-utils`
  (slugify, frontmatter parse/serialize, read/list/search/write). The daemon is refactored onto them.
- MIT `LICENSE`.

### Added (continued)
- Daemon read API: `GET /notes`, `/notes/search`, `/folders`, and `/note`, with CORS for local
  origins and guards against path traversal.
- Desktop dark UI: Tailwind v4 design tokens and a three-pane shell (folder sidebar, note list,
  note viewer, status bar) that loads the vault from the daemon with a demo-data fallback.

### Notes
- The desktop vault browser renders note text; Markdown rendering, tag filtering, resizable panes,
  routing, and a note editor are still to come.
