# Lumos - Progress Log

Chronological record of what has been built. Newest entries first within each date.

## 2026-10-13

### Done
- [x] Monorepo scaffold with pnpm workspaces (`apps/daemon`, `apps/desktop`, `packages`)
- [x] Daemon core: command parser, vault writer, handler, Fastify server
- [x] WhatsApp bridge via Baileys (QR auth, allowlist, auto-reconnect)
- [x] HTTP API: `POST /message`, `GET /health`
- [x] `.gitignore`, `LICENSE` (MIT), README
- [x] Desktop app scaffolded (Tauri + React + TypeScript)
- [x] Repository pushed to GitHub (`Muhammad-waqar-uit/Lumos`)

### Done (continued)
- [x] Phase 1: tracking + reference docs (`PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `FEATURES.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/*`)
- [x] Phase 2: `@lumos/shared` (types) and `@lumos/vault-utils` (slugify, parse/serialize, read/list/search/write)
- [x] Refactored the daemon onto the shared packages; `handleMessage` + vault round-trip verified with `tsx`
- [x] `tsc --noEmit` passes for daemon, shared, and vault-utils

### Done (continued 2)
- [x] Daemon read API: `GET /notes`, `/notes/search`, `/folders`, `/note` (+ CORS for local origins, path-traversal and folder guards)
- [x] Desktop dark UI: Tailwind v4 tokens, three-pane shell (Sidebar, NoteList, NoteViewer, StatusBar)
- [x] Desktop loads the vault from the daemon with a demo fallback when it is offline
- [x] Verified live in the browser: real notes listed, opened, and searched; no console errors
- [x] `tsc --noEmit` passes for daemon + desktop; `vite build` succeeds; `/note` traversal returns 400

### Done (continued 3) — tooling, enforcement and workflow
- [x] oxlint replaces the ad-hoc check (TS-version compatible) and prettier owns formatting
- [x] Husky + lint-staged + commitlint installed; hooks cannot be bypassed
- [x] Root scripts added: `lint`, `lint:fix`, `format`, `format:check`, `typecheck`, `build`, `validate`
- [x] `pre-commit` now also refuses to commit on `main`, so the branch workflow is enforced by the tooling
- [x] Unified TypeScript `~6.0.3` across all four workspaces; `typecheck` script in every workspace
- [x] `RULES.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` written; `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md` point at them
- [x] Branching model adopted: short-lived `<type>/<description>` branches, PR into `main`, squash-merge, no direct commits
- [x] Generated Tauri schemas excluded from formatting; `pnpm validate` verified green end to end
- [x] Fixed two real lint findings in the desktop app by deriving state at render instead of repairing it in effects

### Next up
- [ ] Merge this branch through a PR into `main` (first run of the new branch workflow)
- [ ] GitHub Actions running `pnpm validate` on every PR + branch protection on `main`
- [ ] Markdown rendering (react-markdown) + tag filtering
- [ ] Resizable panes, TanStack Router, zustand
- [ ] Phase 3: link expansion, `/find`, `/plan` with Ollama, tagging
